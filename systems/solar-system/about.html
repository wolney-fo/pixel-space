        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to interactive representation of the Solar System! The primary
          objective of this page is to provide an engaging and educational
          visual experience of our Solar System, accurately scaled to
          demonstrate the relative sizes and distances of the celestial bodies.
          By exploring this page, you can gain a better understanding of the
          vastness of space and the unique characteristics of each planet and
          the Sun.
        </p>
        <h2>The scale</h2>
        <p>
          In order to create a comprehensible and accurate model, I have scaled
          the sizes and distances of the celestial bodies based on the size of
          Pluto. In this scale, Pluto's size is set to 2 units (pixels). This
          provides a manageable framework to illustrate the differences between
          the sizes of the planets and the Sun. Here are some key points about
          our scale:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Pluto: 2px</li>
          <li>Mercury: 7px</li>
          <li>Venus: 17px</li>
          <li>Earth: 18px</li>
          <li>Mars: 10px</li>
          <li>Jupiter: 396px</li>
          <li>Saturn: 330px</li>
          <li>Uranus: 144px</li>
          <li>Neptune: 139px</li>
          <li>Sun: 14,364px</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The distances between each planet and the Sun are also scaled down to
          fit this model, giving you a realistic sense of how far apart these
          celestial bodies are in the vast expanse of space.
